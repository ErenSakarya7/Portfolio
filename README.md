I am Eren Sakarya, a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at TED University. I started my education
at TED University in the Fall semester of 2020. During my education, I have learned and applied Java,
C, C++, and Python programming languages. In the projects I have worked on so far, I frequently used
PostgreSQL/MySQL, Java, and Python.
Among my career goals is to contribute to the development of the organization I work for, ensuring
that it has the necessary capabilities in the face of evolving technology, and thus, reaching higher levels.
I also aim to perform my job in an environment where I enjoy what I do. Therefore, before taking my
first step into professional life, I aim to do my internship at your company, benefiting from your
experience and knowledge while also providing value to you.
TeduApp Project:
TeduApp is an App that has been developed by the students at the TED University for the students and
staff of the University. I have worked as a Back End Developer on the project. Since I have worked for
the phase two of the project, our main purpose was to transfer the database from an external database
into the University’s database and keep it there for security and ease of use purposes. Since Phase 2
was mostly focused on the Front-End development I mostly did code analysis and cleaning for feature
use.
Hotel Management Database:
This was a project for our Database Systems course. As a group of 4 we have created a database from
scratch with necessary relations and tables. We have worked with PostgreSQL and used DBeaver to
create and manage the database. We deployed the database to our university’s servers.
Image Processing Projects:
Image processing is a main attraction for me since after I took the Image Processing course in my
university, I have started a curiosity towards it. I have done 4 small different Image Processing projects
for the course and they all can be found in my GitHub account that I have linked above.
Machine Learning Project:
A Machine Learning Project I have done with my 2 more group members for our Introduction to
Statistical learning course. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict
whether a client of a bank will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The dataset used for this project is
the Bank Marketing Data Set, which can be found at
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing. I have used the “bankadditional.csv” with
10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from full dataset, and 20 inputs. Then deployed the
program with Streamlit to Streamlit Cloud so we could see the results easier and better.
